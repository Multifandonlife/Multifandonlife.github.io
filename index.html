There are nine members in the group. The members are<b>Bang Chan, Felix, Lee Know, Hyunjin, I.N., Seungmin, Woojin, Changbin, and Han.</b>
They were in a survival show called Straykids.
Everyone thought Felix and Lee Know wouldn’t make it in the group, but thankfully they did.
If they weren’t in this group i don’t know what we all would do.
Probably many <b>Stays</b>(fandom name) fly over to South Korea and yell at JYP himself.</p>
